Welcome to my GitHub. Here you will be able to find all the projects I work on
while streaming. If you want to check out my streaming efforts head over to my
[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/SociableSteve) page!

## Who I am

Today I am an Engineering Manager with 20 years of experience as an engineer.
My first proper job was back in 2001 as a junior developer working with CGI/Perl.
Since then I've worked with all kinds of technologies, working with both servers
and writing the code that these servers run.

## What's important to me

The things which guide me in my decision making, interactions with others, and
the way I act are:

* Diversity
* Inclusion
* Accessibility
* Psychological Safety
* Developer Experience
* Fail Fast, Learn Quickly
