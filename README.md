Welcome to my GitHub. Here you will be able to find all the projects I work on
while streaming. If you want to check out my streaming efforts head over to my
[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/SociableSteve) page!

## Who I am

My first proper job was back in 2001 as a junior developer working with CGI/Perl.
Since then I've worked with all kinds of technologies, working with both servers
and writing the code that these servers run.

Today I am an Engineering Manager, and work with people more than with code. My
main focus and what's important to me has changed with that, and I am far more
interested in building inclusive and welcoming communities and teams than the
technologies that are used under the hood.

## What's important to me

The things which guide me in my decision making, interactions with others, and
the way I act are:

* Diversity
* Inclusion
* Accessibility
* Psychological Safety
* Developer Experience
* Fail Fast, Learn Quickly

As a hiring manager I always strive to employ, support, and grow people who are
better than I am at things. I have many mantras, but when it comes to being a manager:

> Good managers don't manage people - We lead people, we manage situations.

## Where to Find Me

I have a couple of hiding places on the Internet. You can find me at:

* [Twitch](https://twitch.com/SociableSteve)
* [Discord](https://discord.gg/ApNnwac)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SociableSteve1)

## Technologies I use

These days there are a few core technologies that I use in my modern coding life.

* [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/) with
[WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)

Makes gaming easier to be on Windows. I like to code on Linux when I can, but
dual-booting is a pain, and WSL does a decent job.

* [NeoVIM](https://neovim.io)

I've recently fallen in love with nvim again. There's a repo with my settings
[here](https://github.com/sociablesteve/nvim). I used to use VSCode but nvim
feels a lot more fun, which is why I code.

* [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)

Making WASM games, and doing lower level application programming.

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

All the node and React things. TypeScript is a joy to work with where JS can
quickly become a mess and hard to navigate with larger projects. Occasionally
get stuck with some of the more advanced TS features, but that means I keep
on learning!

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)

I've been using React for so long it's like a second language to me. I can
use it to build functional front-end easily, and enjoy using some of the
newer features (read hooks.)

* [Heroku](https://heroku.com)

Running hosting can be a pain, so I tend to just throw things at Heroku and let
someone else worry about the hosting.
